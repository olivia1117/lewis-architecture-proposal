	<h1>Architecture Project Proposal</h1>
	<h3>Product Name: Lewis Architecture (alternatively known as: OA Architecture)</h3>
	<h3>Team Members: Olivia Adamic</h3>
	<h3>Application Overview</h3>
	<p>This is a webpage designed to explain my project for credit in CPSC 61200 - Software Architecture and Design. 
		The main goal is to help Lewis faculty and students be able to teach and to understand essential computer science
		concepts without worrying about spending more time changing languages, frameworks, or tools. The project is simply
		called Lewis Architecture and it is designed for students of all levels to be able to learn foundational concepts through 
		practice and implementation. It can start from building a basic static website to then expanding it with React and then 
		hosting and deploying a web application through Microsoft Azure with authentication, databases, and APIs which are all skills 
		that are being sought after in the current job market. The project is designed to be modular and extensible so that new 
		concepts can be added in the future or changed if necessary. 

		Ideally, the students will be able to follow along with written tutorials provides on the site linked below
		which also features additional base code, links to helpful resources, and a final example of the project 
		implemented through all the stages. The project is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to use. 
		Happy programming and developing to you all! You got this!

		Stages of Learning: 
		Level 0 - Starting with the Base Code in React
		Level 1 - Learn Some Basics of React to Enhance the UX/UI Design and Make some Basic API calls
		Level 2 - Lewis-Tac-Toe with Azure Hosting and CI/CD
		Level 3 - Lewis-Tac-Toe with Custom Domain and Authentication 
		Level 4 - Lewis-Tac-Toe with Node.js Server and MongoDB Atlas
		Level 5 - Lewis-Tac-Toe with Server-Side File Storage and Sharing

	<h3>Technology Overview</h3>
	  <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript / TypeScript</strong> — Primary front-end language; TypeScript is optional for stronger types</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 / CSS3</strong> — Foundational web markup and styling</li>
        <li><strong>Node.js</strong> — For backend / API development in advanced levels</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Frameworks & Libraries</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>React.js</strong> — Component-based front-end framework</li>
        <li><strong>Vite</strong> or <strong>Create React App</strong> — Project scaffolding and build tooling</li>
        <li><strong>Auth0 React SDK</strong> — Authentication and secure routing</li>
        <li><strong>Mongoose</strong> — MongoDB ODM for Node.js backends</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Cloud Platforms</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub</strong> — Source control, collaboration, and CI/CD integration</li>
        <li><strong>Azure Static Web Apps</strong> — Hosting for front-end deployments with CI/CD</li>
        <li><strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> — Managed NoSQL database for persistent game data and user info</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Authentication & Security</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auth0</strong> — Identity management (OAuth2 / OIDC) for secure login, profile claims, and JWTs</li>
        <li><strong>Environment variables</strong> (.env, GitHub Secrets, Azure settings) — Secure handling of keys and secrets</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Domain & Hosting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GoDaddy</strong> (or any registrar) — Register and manage custom domains</li>
        <li><strong>Azure DNS / registrar DNS</strong> — Configure A/CNAME/TXT records to point domain to Azure Static Web Apps</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>File & Object Storage</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong> — Store user-uploaded assets (avatars, themes, replays)</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Storage</strong> — Alternative cloud storage option for file uploads</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Tooling & Development Environment</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> — Recommended IDE with extensions for linting and formatting</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> — CI pipelines: build, test, deploy</li>
      </ul>
